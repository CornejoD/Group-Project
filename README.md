# Live Sports Stats

## Description

Look up quick stats of your favorite baseball, basketball, and football teams. The user will experience an easy-to-use interface to stay up to date with their teams. We used API's to pull in data from the major league teams to provide quick, and accurate statistics. 

We were looking for a place where we could find stats easy. You'll now be able to look up stats for your favorite team. We learned how to call api's to get the information we needed and apply it to our web page.

## Usage 

Fill in the steps for whatever team you would like to see, and a list of all current stats will appear
